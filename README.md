# FIFI

FIFI is a site dedicated to French Bulldog related questions and a community in the dublin area for meetups.

The French Bulldog Dubin Club has been around for over 10 Years !! 

However , only recently has the club gone to social media to grow its following and recruit some new memebers.

Users of this site who are interested in joining one of the meetups can do so by completing the sign-up form in the contact section.
